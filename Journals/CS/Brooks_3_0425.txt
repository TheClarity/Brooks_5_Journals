 1.)player vs Player
	I think player vs Player will be in the assessment it was something the whole class struggled
	over for 9 weeks and most likely will sturggle to explain if you were to ask the, so why not
	put it in for one last question and test if they really do know the difference.	
 2.) arrays
 3.) arrayList
	like player vs Player this will probably be in because the difficulty of the topic and explaining
	it. The assement might show a few examples and you'll have to tell the difference between the
	Arrays and the arrayList	
 4.) data types
	Data types have and will continue to play a key role in CS, because data types were the
	first thing we were taught in this class, it was for a reason, because it flows within and
	without the java world and lanuages like it. Some still do have trouble between doubles, ints
	and float. 
 5.) for loops
	For loops was the first code we delt with in terminal making it go up to 100 so why not have
	it in out last test.
 6.)  basics of java like classs and methods
 7.) Program necessities
	I have put these together because they go hand and hand but can be seprated into different
	topic and be just as difficult to answer. But the basics of Java would be in the test because
	it is the first lanuage taught in this class and we should be able identify Java when we see
	it. The fact that Java will be in the test makes us think about java even more and the possiblities
	because although, we don't think we can do big things we truly can.
 8.) Assembly
	We are expected to know the true difference between
	low level programming and high level programming.  
 9.) encapsulation
 10.) OOP and its philosophy
	This has been a big part of the class and has been included in every essay throughout the year.
